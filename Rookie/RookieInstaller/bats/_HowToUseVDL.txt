Here is a quick tutorial video: https://youtu.be/CLvLCf4UoAI


All VDL does is run whatever EXE you drop on it against the Virtual Desktop Streamer app. The reason this works is because for whatever reason this treats pirated PCVR games as if they are in your purchased Virtual Desktop games library. Simply injecting through VD never completely worked and now it seems to work even less than before. I suspect that maybe they don't want pirated games to work as paid games do, but this is purely speculation.

How to use:

1. Copy the bat file to your desktop or to the folder of the game you want to run .(you can have a copy in the folder of every PCVR title if you want, it won't hurt anything.)

2. Make sure you have the proper exe, some games have an exe in one of the main folders then an exe in the bin/win64 folder, usually the one in win64 is the correct one. Basically: if it doesn't work first try, try looking in the game directory for another exe you may have missed.

3. Ensure your quest is not asleep and you are connected to your desktop via Virtual Destkop.

4. Drag the EXE file over the VDL bat file and wait for your game to launch. If you're getting the steam store listing for that game, it is not properly cracked.

5. Choose whether or not you want to add additional parameters, -Steam and -VR are added by default so many games will work just fine, but you can now set things like windowed, borderless, etc. Every game will have different parameters so look around online! Games like L.A. Noire actually REQUIRE special parameters to run. I have included my CompanionToVDL.txt file as an example.

NOTE: Shortcut files WILL NOT WORK, this is due to the command prompt not being able to reliable parse .lnk files, which is what all shortcuts are. I hope to fix this in the future!
